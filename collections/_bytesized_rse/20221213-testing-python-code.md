Byte-sized RSE session 3 looked at testing your Python code. The session started 
with a general introduction to software testing applicable across many languages 
followed by an interactive tutorial based on testing of Python code.

A companion podcast is now available as part of the 
[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/) series.
