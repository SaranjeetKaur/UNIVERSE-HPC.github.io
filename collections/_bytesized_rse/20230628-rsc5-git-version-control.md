A re-run of Byte-sized RSE session 7 from series 1 as part of the [5th SSI Research Software 
Camp](https://www.software.ac.uk/Events/research-software-camp-fair-software), which looked 
at intermediate and advanced use of Git version control. This included looking at the 
feature branch workflow model and features such as rebasing and cherry-picking.

A companion podcast is now available as part of the
[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/) series.
