This session looks at the development of web applications with Python using the
Django web framework.

It will begin with some general background on web framework and application
structures and then look at where Django fits in and its architecture.

After looking at the structure of Django and the different parts of a Django
application, we'll move on to the interactive part of the session where you'll
have a chance to build a simple Django web application from scratch!
