Byte-sized RSE session 8 looked at README files. Not a default and often ignored file in the 
top-level folder of your project but a hugely important place for a range of information 
that can make or break the success of your project - either inspiring potential users to 
adopt your software or contribute to your project, or, putting them off entirely and sending 
them running in the direction of a competing tool or codebase!

A companion podcast is now available as part of the
[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/) series.
