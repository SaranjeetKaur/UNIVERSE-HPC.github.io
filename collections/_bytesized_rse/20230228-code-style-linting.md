Byte-sized RSE session 5 looked at the importance of code style in supporting readability 
and maintainability of your code. We also looked at tools for checking your code for 
potential errors (linters) and checking for conformance with styling specifications.

A companion podcast is now available as part of the
[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/) series.
