In the first session of season 2 of byte-sized RSE, we'll look at that 
challenging question that many software developers or researchers will 
be familiar with being asked: "How long will it take?"!

It's also the question most, if not every, software engineer dreads! 
Often, it feels like asking: "how long is a piece of string?"

Luckily, there are some common techniques and practices we can use to 
help us to give reasonable estimates and avoid common pitfalls. In 
this session, we'll be looking at and trying out a couple of them.
