Byte-sized RSE session 4 looked at Continuous Integration providing some background
on the topic and then focusing on the use of GitHub Actions to set up a pipeline to
automatically run tests and related processes on your codebase in response to
specific actions such as merging new code.

A companion podcast is now available as part of the 
[Code for Thought](https://codeforthought.buzzsprout.com/) series.
