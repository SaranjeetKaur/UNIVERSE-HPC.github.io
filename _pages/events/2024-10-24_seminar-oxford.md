In December, 2023 Alces Flight and Women in HPC (WHPC) came together to launch a 12-month project called 'Move the Needle.'  The original aim?  To track a team of volunteers as they attempted to implement EDIA best practices within their personal careers and/or respective organisations over the calendar year.  Almost immediately after launch the project took on a new and rather different life - with some significant lessons learned along the way.  Join Cristin Merritt, CMO of Alces Flight and Advisory Board Member for WHPC as she walks through the ups, downs, and truly wonderful surprises that took place from the moment she was asked, "So what, really, are the people of High Performance Computing (HPC) doing to make our field a more equitable place?"
