### [Register now](https://forms.office.com/e/igH1Dtc0uk).

## Overview:

- üïí **Friday 26th April** 2024, **[10:00 - 16:30 BST](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=UNIVERSE-HPC+Course+Materials+Mini+Hackathon&iso=20240426T10&p1=1233&ah=6&am=30)**
- üåç In person in Oxford and Online via Zoom

The UNIVERSE-HPC project team is organising a one-day Hackathon to enhance the course materials that we‚Äôve been developing over the past couple of years üéâ This will be a great opportunity to network with people interested in training for RSEs, contribute to [training materials](https://train.oxrse.uk/material), and learn about *Gutenberg*, a new training platform!

There will be three strands that you can get involved in and contribute to:

- **Course content**, from beginner to advanced topics
- **Infrastructure**, enhancing/extending/contributing to the Gutenberg training platform
- **Pedagogy**, creating learning objectives for lessons

You can already have a look at the [list of open issues](https://github.com/UNIVERSE-HPC/course-material/issues), if you‚Äôd like, though you're by no means restricted to this list!

This will also be a fantastic opportunity to learn about using and deploying Gutenberg, an open-source teaching platform developed at the University of Oxford, that you could use in your own teaching. Gutenberg uses course materials written in Markdown and offers the features of a learning management system, for example, giving access to a specific group of enrolled students and tracking their progress through a course. Have a look at [an example deployment from Oxford](https://train.oxrse.uk/material).
