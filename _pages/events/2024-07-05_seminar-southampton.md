Running training at a university presents a diverse set of challenges, from securing funding, to teaching academics of all disciplines, to scaling up provision in line with demand. This talk will discuss some of the obstacles we‚Äôve encountered while running training in computational research skills at the University of Southampton, drawing on my experience as the current training lead for the Southampton Research Software Group, and also the experiences of other long-standing members of the group.  After talking through the history of the group‚Äôs training provision, from the first instances of Software Carpentry training run at Southampton back in 2015 to our current training offerings, I‚Äôll discuss the various difficulties we‚Äôve encountered and the solutions we‚Äôve implemented to address them.
