## Overview:
With the rapid move to widescale use of online training kickstarted by the COVID pandemic, there has been a lot of discussion about the best technologies to use for the delivery of lectures and practicals for remote courses, but surprisingly little discussion about the high-level structure such as timetabling. In this talk, Dr David Henty will discuss the pros and cons of a variety of formats that EPCC has used for online training before, during and after the pandemic.

- Welcome & Introduction by the PI Neil Chue Hong: 11:30 - 11:45am
- Main session by Dr David Henty: 11:45am - 12:45pm
- Q&A: 12:45 - 1:00pm
- Lunch at Main Atrium: 1pm - 2pm

Last date to register:
- For Face to Face in Edinburgh: 1st October 2023.
- For Online: 4th October 2023.
